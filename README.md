# Playable-Zones
This repository intends to maintain an up-to-date version control of zones' files synchronized to the live server versions that are allowed to be publicly viewed, and can be made active at any time.

Modifications and changes should only be made to fix errors that don't interfere with the intended direction, and flow of the zone. Any alterations that go beyond this expectation should become its own zone (edition) and be submitted. All changes should be submitted as pull requests. By using this method we can better track and control changes which will be better for both developers and players alike.
